# OP-XY Drum Utility

A Drum Utility for the Teenage Engineering OP-XY inspired by the original Drum Utility for the OP-1/OP-Z.

## Features 
- 24 pads with per-slot trim, reverse, bit depth, sample rate.
- Global bit depth and sample rate to push one setting to every slot.
- Waveform preview.

## To-Do
- Fix Bugs
- adding slicer (convert OP-1/OP-Z drum kits)

## How it works
1) Drop or pick audio files; fill the 24 slots in order.
2) Click a Edit to trim start/end, toggle reverse, pick bit depth and sample rate.
4) Export once something is loaded to get the `.preset` package.
